# Tool for creating Aleph input files

This is a program I used to generate input for the inductive logic programming tool [Aleph](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machinelearning/Aleph/aleph). The intended result was that Aleph would generate rules such as "only sequences with an amino acid with properties X at position Y can form a pre-BCR", but the rules generated were too complex to give any useful information. This might be because the data sets were very similar.

The input for the java program is two lists of aligned amino acid sequences. In this case the program expects them to be 134 residues long, as a few of the sequences in my data had very long CDRs. It then generates an Aleph background knowledge file where the amino acid at each position in every sequence is one fact. The positive and negative example files consist of the sequences in each of the input files. There is also the option to include more background knowledge using the `consult` option. 

A couple of sample input and output files are included. The `testOutput` files were generated by running `java CreateFiles positive_samples negative samples testOutput background`.
