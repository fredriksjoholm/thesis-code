# Support vector machines

For my thesis project, I made an implementation of the [Robust Ensemble of Support Vector Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3144). This implementation can be found in RESMV.py.

I also implemented a few kernels, among others the [Spectrum kernel](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teatimetalks/kernelclub04/spectrum.pdf). These can be found in BioKernels.py.
